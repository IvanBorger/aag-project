### How to setup Anaconda environment:
Run the command: `conda env create -f environment.yml` in a Conda terminal in order to create the environment. This can then be used in Jupyter Notebooks.

### Guidance for Contributions
The "main.ipynb" notebook contains the core code that aligns with our primary research objectives. Please discuss any potential changes within the group and confirm their value before committing to this file. For testing code or new ideas, use descriptive names such as "test_postal_conversion.ipynb" or "test_random_forest.ipynb" rather than committing directly to the main file.
